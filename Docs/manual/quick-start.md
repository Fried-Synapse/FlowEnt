# Quick Start
This is a quick tutorial on how to use FlowEnt. It might seem brief but that's just because FlowEnt is delightfully easy to use and not a lot needs to be said or done to use this animation engine!

##### Prerequisites
- Have any version greater than Unity 2021.3.29 installed.
- Have a project where you want to animate.

##### Download
You can download the library from [Unity's asset store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/flowent-206982), or download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/Fried-Synapse/FlowEnt/releases).

##### Installation
The installation is as simple as plug in play. All you have to do is add it to your project and start using it. There are no additional steps needed.

### Concepts
It's probably best to familiarise with the concepts first because they are slightly different than other animation libraries, but ones you get a hold of them you will unlock a universe of creativity!
- [Animation](~/manual/concepts/animation.md)
- [Tween](~/manual/concepts/tween.md)
- [Echo](~/manual/concepts/echo.md)
- [Flow](~/manual/concepts/flow.md)

### Creating your first animation
Depending on your approach, you can check different pages, weather you want to create code based animations or author them in the editor.

##### Authoring
FlowEnt contains 4 authoring components: Tween, Echo, Flow, and (General)Animations. Just add the component to your game object and start animating. More details about this on the [authoring](~/manual/core/authoring/index.md) pages.

##### Coding
If you like to dabble in c# you can use the coding API of FlowEnt and write your animations in fluent style in your code, which will make it easier to read and understand when things get a bit more complicated. Read all about that on the [coding](~/manual/core/coding/index.md) pages.

### Advanced
FlowEnt is a very scalable and extensible library. You can check out some of the extensibility pages, but also, make sure you check out the tools pages, which can be very useful when you want preview or debug animations.
