# Coding

The scripting API is probably the most important part of FlowEnt. Everything in the editor is build on this API, and the ideology behind the API is to have it as extensible as possible. Check out the [Extensibility](~/manual/advanced/extensibility/index.md) page for more info on that. 

In these 3 pages you can see how to create simple animations with some basic settings but also some more advanced settings.

- [Tween](~/manual/core/coding/tween.md)
- [Echo](~/manual/core/coding/echo.md)
- [Flow](~/manual/core/coding/flow.md)

The demo code is also very useful to asses the power of this library and the extent of the animations that can be created using it. Check out more on [github](https://github.com/Fried-Synapse/FlowEnt/tree/main/Assets/FlowEnt/Demo/Scripts/Runtime)
